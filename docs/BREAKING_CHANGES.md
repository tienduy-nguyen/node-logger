# BREAKING CHANGES

## Version 3.0

- **Dual ESM and CommonJS**: Added support for both module formats. No syntax changes needed from 2.x.
- **Functional style**: Refactored to use a fully functional API, removing internal objects. Update code that accessed internals directly.
- **Node.js update**: Dropped support for Node 14 and 16. Now compatible with Node 18, 20, 22, and above.
- **Removed `colors` dependency**: Now uses a lightweight, custom color handler. No changes to color functionality.
- **Enhanced JSON handling**: Replaced `JSON.stringify` with `fast-json-stringify` for improved performance.
- **Updated `prettyoutput`**: Now uses `@ekino/prettyoutput` for enhanced performance, security, and compatibility.
- **Native UUID generation**: Replaced `uuidv4` with `crypto.randomUUID()` for generating contextIds, leveraging native Node.js capabilities for better performance.
- **Enhanced logMethod dual signature**: Improved support for the dual-signature interface, handling variations in parameter usage. (log with contextId or without contextId)
